Jesus is the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, who sits at the right hand
of God the Father. He is God, Lord and Savior, who came down from his heavenly throne,
into flesh to be a man, a lowly servant. 
He was born of a virgin.
He lived a holy and perfect life. He conquered temptation.
He healed the sick, fed the poor, casted out demons.
He had no degree, yet was called teacher. 
He was poor,yet rich fed others.
He was innocent, and no sin was found in him. 
He is the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. 
And He died on a cross, and rose again on the third day, conquering sin, death and the grave.
He will judge the living and dead. His kingdom will remain forever and ever.
All who leave this world behind and follow him to the end shall be saved.
